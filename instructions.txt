DESCRIPTION :
	Ludo is a two player board game where each player has a chance to roll the dice. When a player rolls a dice, a random number is generated and displayed in the alert in message.
 Corresponding to the random number generated, the player makes a move.  When player1 makes a move and player2 already exists in the particular cell, then player1 has a chance to kill player2,
now player2 has to start from his initial position and vice-versa if player2 has a chance to kill player1. The players roll their dice alternatively. The player who reaches the destination first wins the
game and the game ends.
